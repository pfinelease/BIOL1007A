<font size="4"> This page was created by a Middlebury College Student for the J-term class, "Reproducible Biology in R." My classmates and I are learning to use RStudio to analyze data and create reproducible tests. I have no prior experience with R and am enjoying the challenges and rewards that it presents! </font>
