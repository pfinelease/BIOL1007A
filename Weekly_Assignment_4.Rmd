### Simulate a brand new data frame (the type of data is up to you) and conduct a statistical analysis in R using 2 variables. Create a basic ggplot that goes with the analysis.

Is there a relationship between pine tree age and height in Loblolly?

```{r message=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggthemes)
library(dplyr)
library(plotrix)
library(ggplot2)
data("Loblolly")
print(Loblolly)

pineTreeStats <- Loblolly %>%
  select(c(height, age)) %>%
  mutate(growthRate = height/age) 

view(pineTreeStats)

AvgGrowth <- pineTreeStats %>%
  arrange(desc(age)) %>%
  group_by(age) %>%
  summarize(avgGR = mean(growthRate)) %>%
  arrange(desc(avgGR))


 ANOmodel <- aov(growthRate ~ factor(age), data=pineTreeStats)
summary(ANOmodel)

PinePlot <- ggplot(data=pineTreeStats, 
                   aes(x=factor(age), y=growthRate, fill= factor(age))) +
  xlab("Age (years)") +
  ylab("Growth Rate (ft/yr)") + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_fill_grey()

PinePlot + theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
             panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
             legend.position = "none") 
```

Figure 1. The ANOVA test revealed that maximum growth rate occurs around 10 years of age for pine trees in Loblolly.
